1. Every document must have a unique _id value 
    (by default of type 'ObjectId' but can be of other type)
    (the rest of fields and values are not required)

2. In collection every document can be diffrent (can have diffrent fields and values), 
but still it must have a unique _id value
    - that is not a good way to organize your data obviously
